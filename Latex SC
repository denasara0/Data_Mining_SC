\begin{abstract}
This project applies regression techniques to a real-world dataset to predict individual medical costs based on personal and lifestyle factors. By modeling relationships among variables such as age, BMI, and smoking status, we aim to accurately forecast medical expenses and gain insights into the contributing factors.

\section{Introduction}
For our group’s course project, we will apply the data mining task of regression to a dataset about medical costs in an attempt to learn and make new observations. Our dataset, \textit{Medical Costs}, from Kaggle\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/medical-costs}}, contains information on 10,000 patients. This includes age (continuous), sex (categorical), BMI (continuous), number of children (continuous), smoking history (binary), region (categorical), and medical costs (continuous). 

The most notable feature is the medical cost column, which we will model to forecast and predict based on other variables such as age and BMI. This will help us test our hypothesis: medical costs have direct correlational relationships with other life factors; therefore, if we know these factors, we should be able to accurately predict an individual’s medical costs. We hypothesize that a higher BMI and age will lead to higher medical costs, respectively. Applying methods of regression to this dataset should allow us to make effective predictions and uncover patterns.

\section{Methodology}
Because medical costs are continuous, we believe linear regression will be a suitable tool for this analysis. Our model will be trained and tested using randomly split portions of the dataset to best generalize the model for prediction. The final model will be selected based on predictive accuracy.

Due to the dataset's dimensionality, data visualization may pose challenges. If necessary, we will conduct feature selection to eliminate variables that do not significantly contribute to medical costs. This step will also help us better understand the data's structure and relationships.

\section{Implementation Timeline}
The first step will be to read in and preprocess the data to ensure compatibility with our modeling framework. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing continuous features.

After preprocessing, we will train and test several regression models and compare their performance. Once the analysis is complete, we will prepare a presentation with visualizations and summarize our findings in a written report.
